# View Controllers

## Understanding MVC

- A **Design Pattern** is the skeleton of a solution that solves a given problem that occurs in given context.
- The most widely-used design pattern in ios development is **Model-View-Controller** (**MVC**).
- **MVC** design patterns helps separating concerns by giving each entity one of these responsibilities:

  - representing data and how it can be accessed => **Model**. An entity with this responsibility usually is not tight to a specific application but to a specific domain and can be used in multiple applications in that domain(e.g. classes we write to model data).
  - defining a user-interface (ui) element => **View**. Also an entity with this responsibility is not tight to a specific application nor to a specific domain and can be used in multiple applications in a variety of domains(e.g. elements of UIKit).
  - builds the bridge between the data (**Model**) and the ui (**View**) so that it updates one of which when the other is updated => (**Controller**). The controler usually takes input from the user through the **View** and then update the **Model** accordingly and also listens on the **Model** and updates the **view** accordingly. An entity with this responsibility is tight to an application since it implements the business logic of the application(e.g. subclasses of `UIViewController`).

- A `ViewController` usually:
  - controls a screen.
  - controls a portion of a screen.
  - controls multiple `ViewContreollers` like `UINavigationController` or `UITabBarController` that control navigation in your app.

## Understanding View Loading

- A `UIViewContrpller` is responsible for managing the lifecycle if a `UIView`.
- The lifecycle is represened in 3 methods:
  - `loadView` called on loading the `UIView` and the default behaviur, if not overriden, is to load the `UIView` from a .xib file.
  - `viewDidLoad` called when the `UIView` successfully gets loaded.
  - `viewDidUnload` called whenever the OS decided to unload the `UIView`.

## Responding to Display-related Callbacks

- A `UIViewControlls` also can handle appear/disappear events through those callbacks:
  - `viewWillAppear`.
  - `viewDidAppear`.
  - `viewWillDisappear`.
  - `viewDidDisappear`.

## Presenting Modal View Controllers

- to present a `UIViewController`:

```objective-c
id controller = [[HelloViewController alloc]initWithNibName:@"HelloView" bundle:nil];

[self presentViewController:controller animated:YES completion:nil];
```

- to dismiss the presented `UIViewController`:

```objective-c
[self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
```
