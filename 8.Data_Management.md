# Data Management

## Archiving Data

- To persist data in the ios platform, we have multiple options:

  - Using database solutions such as SQLite.
  - Using Core Data framework.
  - Archiving.

- For a simple app, we can go with **Archiving** option.

- **Archiving** works by saving your data in a file having the data in binary format. After that you can retrieve the data and get them in form of objects as you saved them.

- To get a reference to documents folder in which you will save your data:

```objective-c
NSArray *urls = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLsForDirectory:NSDocumentDirectory inDomains:NSUserDomainMask];
```

- To get a reference to a file in that directory:

```objective-c
self.fileUrl = [[urls lastObject] URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"iMusic.data"];
```

- To write data:

```objective-c
NSArray *items = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Hos", @"Hesham", @"Soad", nil];

NSData *fileData = [NSKeyedArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:items];

[fileData writeToURL:self.fileUrl atomically:YES];
```

- To read data:

```objective-c
NSData *data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:self.fileUrl];

NSArray *items = [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithData:data];
```

- In order to persist custom data using **Archiving** option, we have to specify how this data would e serialized and deserialized.

## Understanding Protocols

- A `Protocol` in **ObjectiveC** represents a contract between objects of different classes to define how a given operation can be implemented on all thos different entities. In other programming languages they are called interfaces. While, in **ObjectiveC**, a class can inherit from a single class, it can implement any number of protocols.

```objective-c
@interface Artist : NSObject <NSCoding>
```

By this, `Artist` class inherits from `NSObject` and implements `NSCoding` protocol. In the angle brackets you can provide any number of protocols separated by a comma.

- A `class` is said to **confirm** ot **adopt** to a `protocol` if it implements all the `required` methods by that `protocol`.

## Adopting NSCoding

- In order to archive custom data, we have to adopt to `NSCoding` protocol. `NSProtocal` expects you to define 2 methods in order to adopt to it:

  - `encodeWithCoder` called whenever you attempt to archive an instance.

  ```objective-c
  (void)encoudeWithCoder(NSCoder*)encoder {
    [emcoder encodeInteger: self.id forKey: @"id"];
  }
  ```

  - `initWithCoder` called whenever you attempt to unarchive an instance.

  ```objective-c
  (id)initWithCoder(NSCoder *)decoder {
    self = [self init];

    if (self) {
      self.id = [decoder decodeIntegerWithKey: @"id"];
    }

    return self;
  }
  ```

In this implementation, we encoded/decoded only `id` variable, but we can encode/decode as many variables as we wish.
