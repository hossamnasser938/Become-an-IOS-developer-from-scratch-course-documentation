# StoryBoards

- **StoryBoards** is a great feature from ios that reduces the amount of code you write by letting you handle transitions from screen to another through dragging and dropping.

- Using **StoryBoards** can eleminate or at least reduce the usage of xib files.

- The way we can pass data between controllers is by setting this data as instance variables of the destination controller and then in the controller we can access this data using `self.anyVariable`.
