# ObjectiveC Essentials

## ObjectiveC Overview

- **ObjectiveC** is considered a featured version of C (lime C++).
- It's created by **NeXT** which is the company established by Steve Jobs when he left Apple.
- It's used to build the foundations of MacOS and IOS.
- It adds to C:

  - **Object Oriented**.
  - **Dynamism** which is represented in 3 types:

    - **Dynamic Typing**
      It follow **Duck typing** instead of **Normal typing** used in C. **Duck Typing** is the ability to treat different instances the same if they look the same regards of from which class they have been created "_If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck_".

    - **Dynamic Binding**
      the signature of methods can be evaluated at run time.

    - **Dynamic Loading**
      the ability to load modules lazily.

## Creating Classes

- A `class` in **ObjectiveC** is defined through 2 files:

  - `.h` which is the `interface` and represents the public api of that `class` without any implementation details.

  ```objective-c
  @interface Artist : NSObject

  @end
  ```

  Here we defined an interface named `Artist` that extends from `NSObject`.

  - `.m` which is the `implementation` and represents the implementation details of the public api in the `interface`.

  ```objective-c
  #import Artist

  @implementation Artist

  @end
  ```

## Declaring and Implementing Methods

- Declaring methods in **ObjectiveC** is done through 2 steps:

  1. the first is to declare the prototype of the method in the `interface` with no implementation.

  ```objective-c
  - (void) markAsFavourite;
  ```

  2. and then copy and paste that prototype in the `implementation` followed by adding the implementation.

  ```objective-c
  - (void) markAsFavourite {

  }
  ```

- Like almost all object-oriented programming languages, **ObjectiveC** has 2 types of mthods that can be defined in a class:

  1. `class` methods (preceded by `+` sign)  
     methods that are related to the class itself and does not depend on the instance[also called `static` in other programming languages].
  2. `instance` methods (preceded by `-` sign)  
     methods that depend on the instance on which it would be executed.

- as you can see the return type is wrapped in parenethesis. This is not limited to return types but it is also the same with parameter types.

```objective-c
- (void) setName: (NSString *)name;
```

Here `setName` method accepts a single param named `name` of type `NSString`. `*` reveals that it is a pointer type. Unlike primitive types, all object types are declared as pointer types.

- In **ObjectiveC**, all parameters must be named. For me, defining methods with multiple parameters is a bit weired.

```objective-c
- (return_type) function_name:( argumentType1 )argumentName1
joiningArgument2:( argumentType2 )argumentName2 ...
joiningArgumentn:( argumentTypen )argumentNamen;
```

the difference between `joiningArgument2` and `argumentName2` is that `joiningArgument2` is used when invoking the method to specify the value you pass for that parameter while `argumentName2` is the one used in the method body when you wanna refer to the value passed for that parameter. Let's see an example.

- definition

```objective-c
+ (int) sum: (int) num1 secondNumber (int)num2 {
  return num1 + num2;
}
```

assume that this method is declared within a class named `Math`.

- invokation

```objective-c
int n1 = 5;
int n2 = 10;
int s = [Math sum: n1 secondNumber: n2];

# s is 10
```

Note that we called the method `sum` on the class `Math` not on an instance of it since it is defined as a `class` method.

## Sending Messages

- In **ObjectiveC**, **invoking methods** is known as **sending messages**.
- Sending messages is done by wrapping the object or the class in a square bracket and then specifying the method name.

```objective-c
[Class_Or_Object method_name];
```

- Before sending messages on an instance of a class, we have to allocate memory and initialize it. Assume that `A` is a `class` and `setName` is an instance method.

```objective-c
A *a = [[A alloc] init];
[a setName:@"Hossam"];
```

Literal strings must be preceded with `@`.

## Memory Management

- Unlike high-level languages such as **JavaScript**, **Python**, etc, in **ObjectiveC** you do memory allocation and deallocation[Apple introduced the ability to automate that using **Reference Counting algorithm**]. We already saw how to alloc some memory for an object. To dealloc or free an object, you should invoke `release` method on the object.

```objective-c
[a release];
```

## Creating Object Instances

- **ObjectiveC** does not have **constructors**. Instead, it relies on two steps for initiating a new instance.

1. invoking `alloc` method to allocate memory for that instance.
2. invoking `init` method or a custom inplementation of it to initialize that instance with a valid state.

for example:

```objective-c
NSMutablestring *str = [[NSMutableString alloc] initWithString: @"Hello, world!"];
```

Here is how you can provide any custom init method for a class:

```objective-c
- (id)init {
  self = [super init];

  if (self) {
    // any custom initialization logic goes here
  }

  return self;
}
```

- Manually managing when to alloc and when to free memory id tedious. We can automate that using what's called **convenient initializerz**. The basic idea is to provide a method that, allocates, initializes, and autoleases the instance.

```objective-c
- (id)convenient_init {
  return [[[A alloc] init] autorelease];
}
```

A here is assumed the class name.

## Declared Properties

- Most of the methods we write is **accessors**. For that reason, **ObjectiveC** has a feature named **Declared Properties** that automates generating these accessors.
- **Declared Properties** are implemented in 2 steps:

  1. the first is to declare it in the `interface`

  ```objective-c
  @property (attributes) propertyType propertyName;
  ```

  attributes are what defines the implementation of the accessors generated.

  2. the second step is to **synthesize** the property in the `implementation`

  ```objective-c
  @synthesize propertyName
  ```

  or

  ```objective-c
  @synthesize propertyName = _propertyName
  ```

  this helps distinguishing between accessors names and actual property name.
