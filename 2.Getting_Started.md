# Getting Started

## Understanding the Skeleton App

- When the user hits the icon of an app from Home Screen, the first thing the gets executed is the `main` function.
- The `main` function just invokes another function named `UIApplicationMain` passing the name of the `Application Delegate` class.
- The `UIApplicationMain` function:
  - reads `info.plist` file which holds the app configuration.
  - creates an instance of `UIApplication` which is a single instance for each app and responsible for managing app lifecycle and Event Loop.
  - binds the `Application Delegate` class (got from `main` function).
- The `Application Delegate` class is responsible for:
  - customizing app lifecycle methods such as `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` which executes right after the app has been launched.
  - creates an instance of `UIWindow` which wraps application ui.
  - sets its root to a `ViewController` which is responsible for building ui and responding to user interactions.
